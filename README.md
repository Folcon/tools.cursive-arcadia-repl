# tools.cursive-arcadia-repl
An [nREPL] bridge for [Arcadia Unity]. Heavily inspired by [arcadia.nrepl](https://github.com/spacepluk/arcadia.nrepl),
with the difference of redirecting eval operations to Arcadia's nREPL rather than its UDP REPL. Cursive specific operations
are not redirected but evaluated in the bridge as they require the JVM.

## How to use
TBD
